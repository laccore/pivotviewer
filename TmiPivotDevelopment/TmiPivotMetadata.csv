Low to moderate relief. Cleavage planes frequently visible as platy layers. Classic bird's eye extinction (mottled, pebbly texture) not always present in smear slide. Very low apparent birefringence (pseudo-isotropy) because flakes settle with {001} in the plane of the slide.  However, by tilting the slide very slightly (e.g., by slipping another slide under the slide) one can evaluate the true birefringence (thanks to Frank Brown, U. Utah, for the tip).  Biotite has strong birefringence; chlorite, which may form as an alteration product or a metamorphic mineral, can look similar to biotite in plane light but has weak birefringence.","Flaky Pseudo-isotropic Pleochroic bird's-eye-extinction","brown green layers ragged silicate mica transparent","Cross-Polarized Light"
